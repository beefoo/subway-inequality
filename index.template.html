    <h1>The Subway Above Ground</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Income inequality is a defining characteristic of New York City, but it is easy to be unaware of it. Many New Yorkers use the subway to get around, rendering the above ground conditions of the places we travel through largely invisible. In this piece, I use music as a metaphor and measure of inequality, and the subway as a means of following the data through space and time.
    </p>

    <p class="instructions">
      Here you can stream or download one of 46 media files that loosely follow full rides along 23 of the MTA subway lines in both directions. Once you start to play the file, find your station, and listen to the song in the background as you ride the subway. The <strong>quantity and power of the instruments</strong> at any given moment in the song correspond to <strong>the median household income</strong> of the neighborhood that you are passing through. The result is a meditative piece in which the dramatic contrasts of a song echo the dramatic differences of income in the city.
